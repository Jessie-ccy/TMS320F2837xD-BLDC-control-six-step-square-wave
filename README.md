Use a button with an interrupt to control the motor. Initially, the motor rotates forward. Press the button once to stop the motor, and press it a second time to reverse the motor.
Read the ADC value and use PWM to adjust the equivalent voltage while the motor is running, thereby controlling the motor's speed.
